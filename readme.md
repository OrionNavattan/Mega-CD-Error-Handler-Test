Mega CD Mode 1 ROM used to test my experimental Mega CD Error Handler, a custom Moduled Kosinski implementation for compressing sub CPU code in ROM, and initialization code. Can, and will be, used as a base for other test programs.
Boots to green screen if initialization is successful, red screen if no Mega CD is found, and to blue screen if Mega CD BIOS cannot be identified.

Includes code from [Devon's Mode 1 Library](https://github.com/DevsArchive/mcd-mode-1-library), [VladikComper's Error Handler](https://github.com/vladikcomper/md-modules), and FlameWing's [MDComp](https://github.com/flamewing/mdcomp).
Custom KosM compressor by Clownacy based on his [ClownLZSS](https://github.com/Clownacy/clownlzss), with an additional modification by myself.
