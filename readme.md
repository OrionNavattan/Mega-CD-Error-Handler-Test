Mega CD Mode 1 ROM used to test my experimental Mega CD Error Handler, a custom Moduled Kosinski implementation, and initialization code.

Includes code from Devon's Mode 1 library, VladikComper's Error Handler, and FlameWing's MDComp.
Custom KosM compressor by Clownacy, with an additional modification by myself.
